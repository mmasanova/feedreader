## How to Run the Feed Reader ##

Clone the repository and open the index.html using the browser and a local server. Alternatively you can run the feed reader using [this link](https://mmasanova.github.io/feedreader/).

The feed reader shows the title of the selected group of feeds at the top. 

To change the group of feeds showing, click the menu icon on top left and select one of the other topics available in the menu. The feeds for the new topic will appear on the screen and the menu will close.

If you wish to read more about what you see in a feed, click on the feed. This will open up a website with more information in the existing browser window. To return back to the feed reader simply navigate back in your chosen browser.
